# NYC Citi Bike Analysis
This is a summary of the analytical work that I did with the NYC Citi Bike data.

## Story Point 1
In this story point I am examing the graph measuring trip duration relative to birth date. As we can see from this graph, the longest trips occur when the bikes are used by people born around 1990. This is a good sign for a potential bike sharing operation in Des Moines, as the average birth year in Des Moines is 1987 (source: Des Moines Census). One thing worth noting in terms of outliers. There is a dramatic spike in trip duration for those born in 1969. This is most likely the result of one or several malfunctions in which the end of the trip was not properly recorded. I am confident in this as the result for 1969 is almost 500% larger than the next largest--indicative of a significant outlier.

## Story Point 2
In the pie chart provided, it is clear that the vast majority of Citibike users in New York City were male (about 2/3). In Des Moines, the male population only makes up about 49% of the total (source: Des Moines census). Thus, it will be important for us to heavily market towards a female audience if this venture is launched.

## Story Point 3
One of the most important factors for a business is retention of customers. The data from New York City thus paints an optimistic view of our potential future operation. Seen in this story point, over 75% of customers for Citibike were subscribers. This is promising as it shows the potential for sustained usership and profits over time for our own operation in Des Moines. One other point to be optimistic about, 64.3% of the population of Iowa is in urban areas (source: Iowa.gov), so there are plenty of potential subscribers in population centers.

## Story Point 4
One point I want to elaborate more on for this story point is the usage of the bikes as a part of tourist activities. In New York, many of the most popular locations were near large tourist areas. We can probably assume this trend will continue in Des Moines. With this is mind, Des Moines currently has over 70 bike trails used by tourists to explore the city (source: TrailLink). Thus, there could be added profits by users using the bikes as part of the tourist attraction, and note solely for transportation to each attraction. 

## Story Point 5
This story point demonstrates why Des Moines is an ideal location for a bike sharing service, given the temperature at peak usage hours. In New York City during August, the peak usage time for the bikes was the late afternoon/early evening. In Des Moines, the weather at this time during August is a very nice 85 degrees (source: Weather Spark). Thus, weather will not be an obstacle to bike usage during the summer months.
