# NYC Citi Bike Analysis
This is a summary of the analytical work that I did with the NYC Citi Bike data.

## Story Point 1
In this story point I am examing the graph measuring trip duration relative to birth date. As we can see from this graph, the longest trips occur when the bikes are used by people born around 1990. This is a good sign for a potential bike sharing operation in Des Moines, as the average birth year in Des Moines is 1987 (source: Des Moines Census). One thing worth noting in terms of outliers. There is a dramatic spike in trip duration for those born in 1969. This is most likely the result of one or several malfunctions in which the end of the trip was not properly recorded. I am confident in this as the result for 1969 is almost 500% larger than the next largest--indicative of a significant outlier.
